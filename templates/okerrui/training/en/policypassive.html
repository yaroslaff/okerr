<p>
At last task we created policy, which are good for active check. Now we will create policy for passive checks.
</p>

<p>
At <a href="{% url 'okerr:project' project.get_textid %}">project page</a> create policy 'test:passive' for passive indicators. Configure it this ways:
<ul>
    <li>Set 'secret' (password, which should be set at okerrclient to update indicators)
    <li>Autocreate is on.
</ul>

Create passive indicator (created from okerrclient) with this policy, e.g.:
<br>
<code>
    okerrupdate --secret MySecret --policy test:passive test:ppp OK
</code>

</p>
