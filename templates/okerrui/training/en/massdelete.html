<p>Sometimes you have to delete indicator. Each tariff has it's own limitation on maximal number of indicators (maxindicators). You can see it on  <a href="{% url 'myauth:profile' %}">profile</a> page.

You can delete each indicator on indicator page. But if you have to delete many indicators this way, it can take long time.

<p>
Main page (project indicators) has feature to delete few indicators at once. There is checkbox on left of indicator name to perform group operation. To avoid situation when wrong indicators are accidenly deleted, there is limitation - only disabled indicators could be mass-deleted. You have to delete 3 indicators. Check it, disable ("Enable on/off"). Buttons for mass operations are located at lower part of page, after indicators list. Check it again, and delete it (mass operation).
