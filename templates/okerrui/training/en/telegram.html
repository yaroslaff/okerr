Connect Telegram messenger to your account.

<ul>
    <li>Install Telegrap app on your phone.

Command /on binds telegram chat (where you did this command) and account. Field 'Telegram username' of profile must match telegram username.

If you dont have username in telegram, you can either set username, or you will get error message with chat id. You can use this chat id instead of username for 'telegram username' field and repeat <b>/on</b> command.
